    <h1>These are my favorite places!</h1>
    <h2><strong>Seriously</strong>, I hardly leave Portland</h2>
    <p>When I do get the opportunity to leave Portland, I like to visit the following places:</p>
    <h3>Newport, Oregon</h3>

      Newport is awesome because I mean, <em>who doesn't like the beach?</em> There are small shops everywhere that you can spend your small amount of remaining savings on! Also, you can visit the <a href="http://aquarium.org/?gclid=CPn3woqZo84CFZRbhgodDTsJ3Q">Oregon Coast Aquarium</a>. Or find yourself at Newport Cafe, a 24 hour diner that serves tons of greasy deliciousness.
    </p>
    <h3>Chicago, Illinois</h3>

    <p>I honestly don't remember much from here except for <a href="http://www.msichicago.org/">The Museum of Science and Industry</a>. It has a bunch of cool stuff.
    </p>
    <h3>Tokyo, Japan</h3>

      Tokyo has so many <strong>cool</strong> places to visit! Like cafes. There are maid cafes, robot cafe, cat cafes, owl cafes, and more! You can also visit historical places like Meiji Shrine, and the Imperial Palace <em>if</em> you like that kind of thing.
